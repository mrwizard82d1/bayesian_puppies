# Exercises Chapter 2

## Exercise 2.1

### Model A

p(1) = 0.25
p(2) = 0.25
p(3) = 0.25
p(4) = 0.25

This model is a uniform model; each value is equally likely.

### Model B

p(1) = 1/10
p(2) = 2/10
p(3) = 3/10
p(4) = 4/10

This model is biased to increase probability with value. Physically, this distribution models a physical process that might result from the pips being composed of jewels; that is, more pips implies more weight which results in sides with more pips more likely to *be* on the bottom.

### Model C

p(1) = 12/25
p(2) = 12/50
p(3) = 12/75
p(4) = 12/100

This model is biased to decrease probability with value. Physically, this distribution models a physical process in which the pips are actually holes that *reduce* the weight of a given side. Because side 4 has less weight, it is less likely to land on the bottom of the die.

## Exercise 2.2

### Data: all sides equally likely

If the observed distribution of 100 rolls is 1: 25, 2: 25, 3: 25 and 4:25, the credibility of the our three model changes so to increase the probability of model A (uniform probability). It *will not* increase to 1, but the the probability  of each of the other models will move to Model A.

If the observed distribution of 100 rolls is 1: 48, 2: 24, 3: 16, 4:12, the allocation of probability will shift from an equal distribution over the three models to increase the probability of Model C. Again, the probability of Model C will not be one. In addition, the Model B will probably "lose" more probability than Model A.
