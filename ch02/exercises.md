## 2.1

The probabilities are caclulated in file://exercies-2.1.xlsx.

Model A, in which the probability of landing on any face is constant, is an unbiased model; that, is the probability of the downward face is the same independent of the value on the face. Model B has a bias toward higher numbers; that is, the probability of a value is larger if the value if larger. This model is a model one would expect if the pips were heavy jewels: a heavier face is more likely to finish on the bottom of the die. Model C has a bias toward lower values; that is, the larger the number of pips, the **lower** the likelihood of that face landing downward. This model could be generated by rubber pips extending from the face. More pips, more bounce and the less likely that face lands downward.

## 2.2

I cannot give a number (yet) for how much my beliefs change; however, if I observed an equal number of 1's, 2's, 3's and 4's, my belief in model A would be much, much higher. (The observed values show no bias toward any value.)

Similary, if I observed 48 1's, 24 2's, 16 3's and 12 4's, my belief that the actual model is model C would increase. (That model has a higher probability of lower numbers.)
